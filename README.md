# World's First AI Kernel

Welcome to the **World's First AI Kernel** project! This repository contains the source code, tests, and utilities to build, install, and run an AI-powered kernel that integrates advanced AI functionalities into the core system. This kernel leverages AI to optimize hardware performance, provide predictive maintenance, and enhance power management for modern computing environments.

The project includes automated tests that stress-test the kernel across all available CPU cores, ensuring robust performance.

## What AM AI?
I am a kernel driver (`ai_kernel_driver.c`) designed to interface with an AI-enhanced device driver (`/dev/ai_driver`). I include several AI-based features to optimize system performance, maintenance, security, power management, and hardware adaptation. Below is a detailed list of all the AI-based features I provide:

1. **Performance Optimization (AI_IOC_PERF_OPT):**
   - **Description:** I invoke AI algorithms within myself to dynamically optimize system performance.
   - **Implementation:** I handle the `ioctl` command `AI_IOC_PERF_OPT` to trigger performance optimization routines.
   - **Usage:** This feature is activated when the user space application sends the appropriate `ioctl` command.

2. **Predictive Maintenance (AI_IOC_PRED_MAINT):**
   - **Description:** I utilize AI to predict potential hardware failures or maintenance needs before they occur.
   - **Implementation:** I respond to the `ioctl` command `AI_IOC_PRED_MAINT` by performing predictive maintenance checks using simulated AI models.
   - **Usage:** Activated via `ioctl` to proactively maintain hardware reliability.

3. **Security Enhancements (AI_IOC_SEC_ENHANCE):**
   - **Description:** I enhance system security by employing AI techniques to detect and mitigate threats.
   - **Implementation:** I engage AI-driven security mechanisms when handling the `AI_IOC_SEC_ENHANCE` `ioctl` command.
   - **Usage:** Enabled through `ioctl` to bolster security when requested.

4. **Power Management (AI_IOC_PWR_MGMT):**
   - **Description:** I use AI to manage and optimize power consumption based on system usage patterns.
   - **Implementation:** I invoke intelligent power management routines upon receiving the `AI_IOC_PWR_MGMT` `ioctl` command.
   - **Usage:** Utilized via `ioctl` to optimize power usage when needed.

5. **Hardware Adaptation (AI_IOC_HW_ADAPT):**
   - **Description:** I adjust hardware configurations dynamically using AI to meet performance and workload demands.
   - **Implementation:** I accept a `struct hw_config` through the `AI_IOC_HW_ADAPT` `ioctl` command to update buffer sizes and thresholds.
   - **Usage:** Activated via `ioctl` to adapt hardware settings based on user space requests.

6. **Adaptive Buffer Management:**
   - **Description:** I adjust the buffer size for read/write operations to optimize I/O performance based on AI recommendations.
   - **Implementation:** I increase or decrease my internal buffer size using `krealloc` when necessary.
   - **Usage:** Enhances I/O throughput by adapting to workload requirements during performance optimization and hardware adaptation.

7. **Predictive Anomaly Detection:**
   - **Description:** I perform anomaly detection using AI to enhance security and reliability.
   - **Implementation:** I calculate an anomaly score based on error counts and simulated sensor data.
   - **Usage:** Helps in detecting potential security threats and system anomalies.

8. **Power State Management:**
   - **Description:** I switch between normal and low power modes based on system usage.
   - **Implementation:** I monitor usage counts and adjust my `low_power_mode` state accordingly.
   - **Usage:** Optimizes power consumption without user intervention.

9. **Simulated Sensor Data Handling:**
   - **Description:** I simulate sensor data to feed into my AI algorithms for maintenance and security features.
   - **Implementation:** I generate random sensor data within a certain range to mimic hardware sensors.
   - **Usage:** Provides data for predictive maintenance and anomaly detection.

10. **Thread-Safe Operations:**
    - **Description:** I ensure thread-safe interactions using mutex locks.
    - **Implementation:** I use a `mutex_lock` to synchronize access to shared resources.
    - **Usage:** Prevents race conditions when accessed by multiple user space processes.

11. **Comprehensive Error Handling and Reporting:**
    - **Description:** I implement robust error handling to provide informative messages to the kernel log.
    - **Implementation:** I check return values and conditions, logging warnings or errors using `printk`.
    - **Usage:** Helps in diagnosing issues with my operations.

## Features I am  Missing

- **Advanced Machine Learning Models:**
  - I currently use simple simulations for AI algorithms. My creator is working on integrating more advanced machine learning models for better predictive accuracy.

- **User Space Notifications:**
  - I do not yet have a mechanism to notify user space applications of critical events or anomalies. My creator is developing a notification system to alert users in real-time.

- **Dynamic Configuration via Sysfs:**
  - While I accept configurations through `ioctl`, I lack a Sysfs interface for dynamic parameter tuning. My creator is planning to add Sysfs entries for easier configuration.

- **Support for Multiple Devices:**
  - I currently support only a single device instance. Enhancements are underway to support multiple instances for broader applicability.

- **Integration with Hardware Sensors:**
  - My sensor data is simulated. Future versions will integrate with actual hardware sensors to provide real-world data for AI algorithms.

- **Logging Enhancements:**
  - My logging is limited to kernel logs. My creator is working on adding more granular logging levels and possibly exporting logs to user space.



## Getting Started

### Installation

To build and install the AI kernel driver, follow the steps in the [AI Kernel Driver README](src/README.md). This README will guide you through the compilation and installation of the kernel module. Below are quick steps for running the automated installation script, along with explanations for each command:

1. First, navigate to the `src` directory where the necessary files for installation are located by running:

   ```bash
   cd src
   ```

   - *Explanation: The `cd` (change directory) command moves your terminal session into the `src` folder, which contains the installation files and scripts needed to build the kernel driver.*

2. Next, make the `automated_testing.sh` script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x automated_testing.sh
   ```

   - *Explanation: The `chmod +x` command changes the file permission of `automated_testing.sh` to make it executable. Without this step, you wouldn’t be able to run the script directly from the terminal.*

3. Finally, execute the installation script:

   ```bash
   ./automated_testing.sh
   ```

   - *Explanation: The `./` tells the terminal to run the `automated_testing.sh` script from the current directory. The script will automatically handle the build and installation process for the AI kernel driver, compiling the necessary components and installing them in the appropriate locations.*

Following these steps will simplify the process of building and installing the AI kernel driver. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [AI Kernel Driver README](src/README.md).

## Thread Tests

Once the AI kernel driver is installed, you can run tests to ensure it is working as expected. Navigate to the `Max_test/` directory and use the testing scripts. More details can be found in the [Testing README](Max_test/readme.md).

### Run Individual Thread Tests

To evaluate how the AI kernel performs under different computational loads, you can run thread tests. This involves testing individual threads or maxing out all CPU cores. Instructions are available in the [Thread Tests README](thread_tests/readme.md).

### Max Test

The **Max Test** pushes the AI kernel to its limits by running computations across all CPU cores. It ensures the kernel can handle heavy loads efficiently. Detailed instructions for running the Max Test are available in the [Max Test README](Max_test/README.md).

### Automated Testing

Automated testing scripts are available in the `ALL directories`. Use these scripts to run a full suite of tests that assess the kernel’s performance across various dimensions.
